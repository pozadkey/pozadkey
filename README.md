### Web & Mobile Engineer

I\'m a self-taught software engineer who enjoys crafting web and mobile applications on the internet using Javascript and Flutter.

I\'m always on the look out for technical and professional opportunies to improve my skill-set and experience for building an outstanding User Experience.
